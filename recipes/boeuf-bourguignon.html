                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>We present you a culinary hit straight from the land of Toussaint! Thanks to courtesy of CD Projekt
                    RED
                    we were able to make this dish with the original Butcher of Blaviken wine. The label says that itâ€™s
                    the
                    wine embodiment of Geralt of Rivia. Made of Vermentino grapes (dark variety), crushed with silver
                    swords, spiced up with sweat and fermented in saddlebags, the Butcher of Blaviken wine leaves a
                    rough
                    feeling on the lips and a tangy taste of blood and skin, and bites like no other on the next
                    morning. It
                    calms the nerves after the fight with botchling, and also can lull to sleep despite zeugl's foul
                    odor on
                    the clothes. Apparently it tastes great with a chicken sandwiches.</p>

                <p>Such unusual and rare liquor deserves a decent dish-pairing, so we chose one of the most exquisite
                    food
                    appearing during the adventure in Toussaint. Burgundy Beef, or "boeuf bourguignon" - is clearly
                    inspired
                    by French cuisine and can be purchased from local innkeepers throughout Toussaint.</p>

                <p>Preparation in Burgundy style means the use of characteristic ingredients: wine, pearl onions,
                    mushrooms, and often also bacon and bouquet garni (bouquet of spices - mainly with parsley, bay
                    leaf,
                    thyme and other herbs). Many recipes for this beef focus on the roast version, but due to the rather
                    difficult availability of the appropriate oven on the trail we decided to stew it in a pot. We also
                    omit
                    the marinating stage to slightly reduce the total preparation time.The proposed recipe is based on a
                    traditional recipe, but slightly simplifies the preparation, so that each traveler can enjoy the
                    exquisite taste of this unique dish.</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>CHOICE OF WINE AND MEAT</b>
                        <p>Butcher of Blaviken unfortunately can not be bought in stores, but it can be successfully
                            replaced
                            with regular red dry wine. It is important that you buy the liquor you like, so try it
                            before
                            cooking. Let Melitele protect you against adding wine you do not really savour - after
                            cooking
                            it
                            will not be any better!</p>

                        <p>When it comes to meat, a brisket will be great for the dish. It is a relatively cheap piece
                            of
                            beef,
                            you can stew it for a long time, and it also contains bones that will be useful for making a
                            broth.
                            You can also buy a shin or bladel. It is also worth asking a good local butcher for a piece
                            of
                            meat
                            dedicated for long cooking.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>PORK FAT/BACON</b>
                        <p>Remove the skin from the bacon and cut the fat into thin slices - about 1cmx4cm. If it's
                            smoked,
                            you
                            can cook it for a few minutes in boiling water and drain off (that the taste of the smoked
                            meat
                            should not be too intense to other ingredients). Heat up the oil in a frying pan, put the
                            pieces
                            of
                            bacon and fry, stirring occasionally, until you get a brown crust. The fat should mostly
                            melt.
                            Put
                            the scratchings into a pot in which we will cook the stew. Leave the melted fat in the pan
                            for a
                            further use.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>MEAT AND BROTH</b>
                        <p>Remove the larger pieces of fat from the meat (leave the smaller ones - it will enrich the
                            taste
                            and
                            consistency of the stew) and separate the meat from the bones. Then put the bones in a
                            saucepan,
                            add
                            thyme, some salt and pour 1.5 glasses of water. Cook under lid, simmer for about 1 hour.
                            After
                            this
                            time, discard the bones, strain the stock and set it aside.</p>

                        <p>Cut the separated meat into bigger pieces, more or less 10x5cm - often the recipes recommend
                            to
                            cut
                            the meat into a finer cube, but this causes the juices to run away from it, so it is better
                            to
                            fry
                            the larger pieces and then cut them into smaller ones. Use the pan with the remaining fat
                            from
                            bacon, warm it up and put pieces of beef - they can not touch each other and should have
                            some
                            space.
                            The point is that they will fry, not stew. Fry the pieces for about 2-3 minutes on each side
                            for
                            strong browning. They will be still raw in the inside, but this is how it should be. Then
                            put
                            the
                            pieces of meat on the plate to cool down. When they are cold, cut them into smaller
                            particles,
                            for
                            example thick stripes. Then transfer them into a pot with pork scratchings.</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>ONION + GARLIC</b>
                        <p>Chop the onion and fry on the same pan for about 3 minutes until brown, stirring (if
                            necessary,
                            add
                            some oil). Add the crushed garlic and fry for half a minute. Transfer everything into a pot
                            with
                            bacon scratchings and beef.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>CARROTS</b>
                        <p>On the same pan, fry thick slices of peeled carrots until golden brown, on both sides, add
                            some
                            oil
                            if necessary. After frying, put aside in a separate bowl, because carrots will be added at
                            the
                            end
                            of stewing process.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>MUSHROOMS</b>
                        <p>Wash the mushrooms under running water and cut off the stems. If they are large, cut them in
                            half.
                            Melt the butter in the pan, add the mushrooms and fry until golden brown for about 3-4
                            minutes.
                            At
                            the end, add some salt and pepper, mix. Transfer to a bowl with carrots for a further use.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ONIONS</b>
                        <p>Pearl onions rarely appear in the innkeepers storage (marinated in vinegar from the jar are
                            not
                            suitable), but you can replace them with half cut shallots. Place onions in a frying pan
                            with 1
                            tablespoon of butter and fry for few minutes until golden. Put in a bowl with carrots and
                            mushrooms.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>WINE</b>
                        <p>Put the wine on a hot pan, on which we fried everything, and cook for a while. In this way,
                            we
                            remove from the pan the remains of the "taste" from frying. Then we pour warm wine into a
                            pot of
                            meat.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>SIMMERING</b>
                        <p>Add a beef broth to the pot with bacon, meat, onions, garlic and wine. Add half of the
                            parsley
                            and 1
                            bay leaf. Stir, cover and simmer for about 2-3h until the meat is soft, stirring
                            occasionally
                            and
                            pouring wine if too much liquid boils out. After 30 minutes, remove the parsley, and after
                            1.5
                            hours, add salt and a little tomato paste for taste and a better color. 20 minutes before
                            the
                            end of
                            simmering, pull the bay leaf and add fried mushrooms, onions and carrots. Put the ready
                            goulash
                            out
                            of the fire and season it if necessary.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>SERVING</b>
                        <p>The boeuf bourguignon should be left in the fridge for the whole night - then it will taste
                            even
                            better. We serve the dish with chopped parsley and eat in the company of a large piece of
                            fresh
                            baguette.</p>
