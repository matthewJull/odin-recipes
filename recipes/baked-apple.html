                <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>Witcher's cuisine is not only about aromatic meats and filling stews. In the arsenal of sweet snacks
                    from
                    the game, the most common are fruits, fresh or dried, sweet rolls or nuts and caramels. It's nothing
                    special, but every skilled host knows how to make an ideal dessert with these ingredients!</p>

                <p>Simple sweets can also be a great way to thank a savior - an old woman from
                    White Orchard came out with such an idea in the "A Frying Pan, Spick and Span" quest, who gives
                    Geralt
                    bread, juice and baked apples.</p>

                <p>To prepare this dessert we traditionally used the elements that appear in Geralt's inventory. We also
                    remembered about the alcohol touch - without it the Witcher’s universe would not be complete! Dried
                    fruit
                    and nuts as stuffing, a salted toffee sauce with alcohol and a spicy note move the common baked
                    apple
                    into a
                    new dimension of quality!</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <i>CARAMEL SAUCE</i>
                        <p>Add sugar to a saucepan with a thick and light bottom. Heat it moderatly and shake a saucepan
                            to
                            evenly melt it. When it's dissolved, reduce the fire to a minimum and control the color of
                            the
                            caramel. When it's intensely amber, add warmed whipping cream - beware, it will hiss like an
                            angry
                            wyvern! Vigorously mix it with a wooden spatula.</p>

                        <p>At the beginning, caramel clumps will form, which
                            will completely dissolve as they warm up. Cook the mixture over a low heat for about 10-15
                            minutes.
                            Stir from time to time until the sauce is smooth. Then add alcohol (rum, vodka or nut liquor
                            -
                            you
                            can also omit this ingredient), salt and spices. Mix everything and cook for a few minutes -
                            the
                            final consistency should resemble liquid honey and its color should be close to one of the
                            toffee
                            candies.</p>

                        <p>Turn off the heat, add the soft butter and mix. Cool the sauce. When it reaches room
                            temperature, the caramel thickens. In case it becomes too thick, you can add more cream or
                            alcohol.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <i>NUTS AND DRIED FRUIT</i>
                        <p>The nuts and dried fruits mix presented in the ingredients is just a suggestion - the types
                            and
                            proportions of nuts and fruits can be freely changed. Ready mixtures will also work. Cut
                            nuts
                            and fruits into smaller pieces. Then put them in a bowl, add 2 teaspoons of caramel sauce
                            and mix thoroughly. Set aside and go to the next point.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <i>APPLES</i>
                        <p>Wash the apples and cut off the "hats" with a sharp knife (or possibly with the Witcher's
                            sword)
                            about 3/4 of the height - so that the petiole is held in the flesh. Pull out core with a
                            knife by
                            cutting a small circle and taking it out with all the seeds. Be careful not to break the
                            apple
                            through. It is good to help yourself with a spoon to remove unnecessary content.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <i>STUFFING</i>
                        <p>Grease a deep baking mold with butter. Fill the core holes in apples with nuts and raisins
                            and press
                            them with a spoon to thoroughly fill the empty space. Cover the stuffed apples with cut off
                            hats -
                            try to match them exactly to the cutting line. Spread each apple on the surface with soft
                            butter
                            (preferably done it with your fingers).</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <i>BAKING</i>
                        <p>Put the form with apples into a preheated oven (170°C/325°F) and bake for about 30-40 min
                            depending
                            on the size, type and maturity of the fruit. The apples are ready when their skin is
                            slightly
                            wrinkled. In addition, you can check their softness with fork and bake a little longer if
                            necessary.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <i>SERVING</i>
                        <p>Apples are best served immediately after baking. Each of them should be poured with a heavy
                            portion
                            caramel sauce. After consuming, the apple regenerates 50 health points and regenerate the
                            motivation to fight
                            monsters. </p>
