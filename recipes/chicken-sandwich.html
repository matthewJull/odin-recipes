                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Chicken sandwich appears already in the first part of the virtual adventures of Geralt of Rivia, and
                    it
                    makes a serious comeback in Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, where it’s a quite common consumable - you can
                    buy
                    it at the innkeeper or find in boxes or .... loot it from fallen enemies. This snack slowly restores
                    health in case of no other options. In addition, we can also find the version with roasted chicken.
                    Because it appears almost everywhere during our journey, the sandwich has become one of the most
                    famous
                    food item from the game.</p>

                <p>As famous and useful item during the game, this dish requires a proper treatment. It is impossible to
                    imagine the Witcher’s universe without a lot of liquors - there are several types of alcohol in the
                    game, so we will use Kaedweni Stout with a strong smoky aroma for a chicken marinade. We will also
                    add
                    grilled mushrooms and sauce with chopped parsley to finally close everything in rustic slices of
                    sourdough bread.</p>

                <p>Such a sandwich makes an ideal regeneration snack for keeping the vital strength during long hours of
                    fierce gameplay!</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>MARINADE</b>
                        <p>Put the ingredients for the marinade into the saucepan (press garlic through the press) and
                            mix
                            thoroughly to combine. As for the choice of beer, it may be a stout, but also a sweet dark
                            beer
                            -
                            then you have to try marinade before adding honey, so that it does not come out too sweet.
                            Put
                            the
                            marinade on a very strong fire and cook to reduce the excess water - a sauce must have a
                            density
                            similar to the roast sauce. It should take about 15-20 minutes. Cool the ready marinade to
                            room
                            temperature and after that, coat cleaned chicken breasts with the marinade and put in the
                            fridge
                            for
                            at least 1 hour.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>SAUCE</b>
                        <p>Combine together mayonnaise, lemon juice, finely chopped parsley and a pinch of pepper and
                            salt.
                            Put
                            the sauce in the fridge.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>GRILLING THE MEAT</b>
                        <p>Frying pan version: Place the marinated meat on a hot, greased pan (preferably grill pan).
                            Fry
                            the
                            fillets for about 4 minutes on medium heat, then turn them on the other side and fry for
                            another
                            5
                            minutes. Additionally, fry each side for 30 seconds, gently holding the meat with tongs. At
                            the
                            end
                            of frying, add a few tablespoons of water (it will sizzle and smoke) and shake the pan. Then
                            cover
                            it with a lid, reduce the gas to a minimum, stew for 1 min and turn off the burner. Pull the
                            chicken
                            out and transfer it to the plate.</p>

                        <p>Barbecue version: In the case of a traditional outdoor barbecue, the meat should be prepared
                            with
                            usage of trays. Grill marinated fillets for approx. 15 minutes, occasionally turning them
                            over
                            and
                            spreading the remains of the marinade. When meat is properly browned, put it on the side of
                            the
                            grate (so that it's not directly above the burning coal) and leave for about 1-2 min of
                            rest.
                            Then
                            transfer it on the plate.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>GRILLING OF MUSHROOMS AND BREAD</b>
                        <p>On the same pan or grill, quickly grill the mushrooms, cut into thick slices (about 1 minute
                            on
                            each
                            side), and finally sprinkle them lightly with salt and coarsely ground pepper. Remove the
                            mushrooms
                            from the pan / grill and toast the slices of bread, also about 1 minute on each side.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>SERVING</b>
                        <p>Spread sauce on a slice of toasted bread, add grilled mushrooms and chicken breast, put on a
                            second
                            slice and also spread with sauce. Lightly press the sandwich with your hand (to make it more
                            convenient to eat) and celebrate the Witcher meal!</p>

                        <p>We are sure that the meat in such a tasty beer marinade would please Geralt! We recommend it
                            as a
                            snack during a little game of Gwent!</p>
